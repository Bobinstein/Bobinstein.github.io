# What is A .md File?

A markdown file (.md) is a simple plain-text document that supports a lot of powerful inline formatting. Markdown has its own special language, but it also supports most html tags to improve content and styling.

Markdown files also support special metadata tags, called "Frontmatter" at the top of the file.
